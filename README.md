# 2D-Filtering-using-VHDL-and-FPGA

Our task is to implement 2D filter to process the images using FPGA and VHDL (Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language). The image if of 128*128 pixels in resolution and the kernel size is 3*3 pixels. The software used for the simulation and implementation is Xilinx ISE (Integrated Synthesis Environment) Design Suite and the language is VHDL.
